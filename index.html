    <!-- This is question two -->
<p>It has been said that every man, consciously or
theory regarding matter. We ourselves —and all the material world
around us—were supposed to consist of these infinitesimal
particles of matter, so small that they could not be seen or weighed
or smelled or touched individually—but still particles of matter and
indestructible.
Now, however, these atoms have been further analyzed, and
physics tells us that they are not indestructible at all— that they
are mere positive and negative buttons of force or energy called
protons and electrons, without hardness, without density, without
solidity, without even positive actuality. In short, they are vortices
in the ether—whirling bits of energy—dynamic, never static,
pulsating with life, but the life is spiritual! As one eminent British
scientist put it— “Science now explains matter by explaining it
away!”
And that, mind you, is what the solid table in front of you is
made of, is what your house, your body, the whole world is made
of—whirling bits of energy!
To quote the New York Herald-Tribune of March 11, 1926:
“We used to believe that the universe was composed of an
unknown number of different kinds of matter, one kind for each
chemical element.

        There is a <b>Napoleonic</b> feeling of power that insures <strong>success</strong> in the knowledge that this invincible 
        <i>“Life Principle” </i>is behind your <em>every act.</em> Knowing that you have working with you <mark>a force,</mark>
         which never yet has <small> failed </small>in anything it has <del> undertaken,</del> 
        you can go <ins> ahead</ins> in the <sub>confident knowledge</sub> that it will not fail in your case, <sup>either.</sub>
